# Yield‑Curve Factor Analysis

This repository contains the code for my **Master’s programme project** that attempts to perform **A Factorial Analysis of the Yield Curve.”*

## What’s inside

* **`yield_curve_factor_analysis.py`** – main script: Nelson‑Siegel estimation, PCA on yields, macro‑augmented Kalman state‑space model, plus basic forecasts and curve reconstruction.
* Historical drafts (`final Yield Curve.py`, `kalman filter.py`, etc.) kept for transparency.
* `data/` folder – expected location for the raw yield‑curve and macroeconomic CSVs (not included in the repo).

## Caveats

This is **not a perfect one‑to‑one replica** of the PDF: some secondary diagnostics and the full impulse‑response section are missing. Use with academic caution.
